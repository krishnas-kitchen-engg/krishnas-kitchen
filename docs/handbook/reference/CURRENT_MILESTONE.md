# Current Milestone

## Purpose

This document captures the currently active milestone so future sessions can resume with context.

## Current Guidance

Update this document whenever a milestone starts, pauses, completes, or changes scope.

## Current Active Milestone

Refresh Living Milestone State After Security Commit.

## Goal

Refresh living planning and reconstruction references after the committed security architecture ownership milestone so repository status reflects current git history.

## Status

Implemented, verified, reviewed, and approved for commit.

## Scope

- Record that security architecture ownership was committed in `c8a4f5c`.
- Refresh current milestone, next milestone, current state, project reconstruction, scorecard, and evidence references that still described the security milestone as pending review or pre-commit.
- Preserve immutable ledger behavior, positive quantity semantics, return/reversal semantics, migrations, Supabase policies, permissions, runtime behavior, Product Horizons, and architecture boundaries.
- Do not implement local queue storage, background sync, service-worker replay, IndexedDB schema, server idempotency constraints, RLS/RPC changes, permission changes, scanning documentation consolidation, stack documentation reconciliation, schema reference generation, or older documentation cleanup in this milestone.
